# About Me
* I am a second-year PhD student in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at UIUC advised by [R Srikant](https://sites.google.com/a/illinois.edu/srikant/home) and [Rasoul Etesami](http://etesami.ise.illinois.edu/). Before that, I was working as a Quantitative Researcher in the High-Frequency Equities team at Quadeye Securities. I have completed my B.Tech (with honors) in the Electrical Engineering Department at Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay with a minor in Computer Science and Engineering.
* My research interests lie in the intersection of privacy-preserving machine learning and game theory. In particular, I am interested in understanding the impact of privacy-preserving techniques on the performance of machine learning models. Moreover, I am also interested in understanding the theoretical interpretations of machine learning models. Before my PhD, I had worked in compressed sensing and radar signal processing.
